#What is BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)?
Visiting this project means that you probably already have an idea of what BDD is and why one would want to use it, and if not, short summary is that:  
Behaviour Driven Development is a software development process from Test Driven Development (TDD), popularized by a gentleman named [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/).  
With BDD, an application is specked & designed by describing how it should behave provided certain Test input.

#Why Another BDD Tool?
##BDD tools in different programming languages
##BDD tools available for Java projects
##Goals for Dumb BDD

*   Should be so simple that no thinking should be necessary to use the tool (see example below)
*   Should Not require a special IDE plugin
*   Should Not require learning another programming language
*   Should work effortlessly with existing test frameworks (e.g. Junit, TestNG) without requiring a special runner
*	The Tests and the Specifications should be maintained in a single place to avoid a disconnect between the two
*	Should use a realistic maintenance process, maintained by developers, then the generated reports shared with other stakeholders

#Who Is Dumb BDD Created For?

*   One that is just starting the habit of writing tests
*   One that has heard about BDD/TDD and wants to start applying it
*   One that has been frustrated by the number of extra tools & languages he/she has had to use to get BDD going in Java
*   One that is struggling to introduce BDD/TDD to their team
*   One that has enjoyed using BDD in a dynamic programming language
*   One that is about to give up on BDD/TDD
